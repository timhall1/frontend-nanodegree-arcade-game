### Quick Start
To run this application, simply download this repo to your local machine, and open `index.html` in your browser.

### How to Play
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player around the map, one square at a time, to make it to the water. If you collide with an enemy bug, you'll get sent back to start. Good luck!
